# DOM-Reference

This repository explains each of the interfaces of the Document Object Model in detail for a better understanding. The following interfaces are included -

- **Document Interface** - The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content.
- **Window Interface** - The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document.
- **Event Interface** - The Event interface represents an event which takes place in the DOM.
- **EventTarget Interface** - EventTarget is a DOM interface implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them.
- **Node Interface** - Node is an interface from which a number of DOM API object types inherit.
- **Element Interface** - Element is the most general base class from which all objects in a Document inherit.
- **ParentNode Interface** - The ParentNode interface contains methods and properties that are common to all types of Node objects that can have children.
- **ChildNode Interface** - The ChildNode interface contains methods that are particular to Node objects that can have a parent.
- **NodeList** - NodeList objects are collections of nodes, usually returned by properties such as Node.childNodes and methods such as document.querySelectorAll()
- **NamedNodeMap** - The NamedNodeMap interface represents a collection of Attr objects.
- **CSS Object Model** - The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML. It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically.
